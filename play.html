    <h3>THE STRONGER</h3>
    <h4><i>Written by August Strindberg</i></h4>

    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X.</h6>[_enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6> MISS Y.</h6>[_has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she is reading an illustrated weekly, and
    every now and then,
    she exchanges it for a new one_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X.</h6>Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>
    <p>[MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes her reading_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X.</h6>Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of
    all times.
    It makes me as sad as when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was reading a comic paper
    and the groom
    was playing billiards with the witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end? Think of it,
    playing billiards
    on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
    dear.</p>
    <p>[_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_MRS. X.,_and disappears again_]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X.</h6>
    <p>[_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
        of Christmas presents._]</p> See what I've bought for my tots.<p> [_Picks up a
        doll._]</p> What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
    eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
    pistol for Carl.</p>
    <p>[_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ MISS Y. MISS Y. _starts as if
        frightened_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X. </h6>Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
    did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
    were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
    in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
    it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
    didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
    matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.
    <p>[_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._]</p>Well, these are for my
    hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
    must have them on everything.</p>
    <p>[MISS Y. _looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
        sarcasm and curiosity_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X. </h6>
    <p>[_Puts a hand in each slipper._] </p>Just see what small feet Bob
    has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never
    seen him in slippers.</p>
    <p>[MISS Y. _laughs aloud_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X. </h6>Look here--here he comes.</p>
    <p>[_Makes the slippers walk across the table._ MISS Y. _laughs
        again_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X. </h6>Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this:
    "Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." Or: "The
    idiot--now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then
    there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold. "Gee, but
    it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep
    the house warm."</p>
    <p>[_She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the
        other._ MISS Y. _breaks into prolonged laughter_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X.</h6> And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippers--Mary
    has pushed them under the bureau. Well, perhaps it is not right to be
    making fun of one's own husband. He's pretty good for all that--a real
    dear little hubby, that's what he is. You should have such a
    husband--what are you laughing at? Can't you tell? Then, you see, I know
    he is faithful. Yes, I know, for he has told me himself--what in the
    world makes you giggle like that? That nasty Betty tried to get him away
    from me while I was on the road. Can you think of anything more
    infamous? [_Pause._] But I'd have scratched the eyes out of her face,
    that's what I'd have done, if I had been at home when she tried it.
    [_Pause._] I'm glad Bob told me all about it, so I didn't have to hear
    it first from somebody else. [_Pause._] And, just think of it, Betty was
    not the only one! I don't know why it is, but all women seem to be crazy
    after my husband. It must be because they imagine his government
    position gives him something to say about the engagements. Perhaps
    you've tried it yourself--you may have set your traps for him, too? Yes,
    I don't trust you very far--but I know he never cared for you--and then
    I have been thinking you rather had a grudge against him.</p>
    <p>[_Pause. They look at each other in an embarrassed manner._]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X. </h6>Amelia, spend the evening with us, won't you? Just to show that
    you are not angry--not with me, at least. I cannot tell exactly why, but
    it seems so awfully unpleasant to have you--you--for an enemy. Perhaps
    because I got in your way that time <p>[_rallentando_]</p> or--I don't
    know--really, I don't know at all----</p>
    <p>[_Pause._ MISS Y. _gazes searchingly at_ MRS. X.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X. </h6>
    <p>[_Thoughtfully._] </p>It was so peculiar, the way our
    acquaintance--why, I was afraid of you when I first met you; so afraid
    that I did not dare to let you out of sight. It didn't matter where I
    tried to go--I always found myself near you. I didn't have the courage
    to be your enemy--and so I became your friend. But there was always
    something discordant in the air when you called at our home, for I saw
    that my husband didn't like you--and it annoyed me--just as it does when
    a dress won't fit. I've tried my very best to make him appear friendly
    to you at least, but I couldn't move him--not until you were engaged.
    Then you two became such fast friends that it almost looked as if you
    had not dared to show your real feelings before, when it was not
    safe--and later--let me see, now! I didn't get jealous--strange, was it
    not? And I remember the baptism--you were acting as godmother, and I
    made him kiss you--and he did, but both of you looked terribly
    embarrassed--that is, I didn't think of it then--or afterwards, even--I
    never thought of it--till--_now_! <p>[_Rises impulsively._]</p> Why don't you
    say something? You have not uttered a single word all this time. You've
    just let me go on talking. You've been sitting there staring at me only,
    and your eyes have drawn out of me all these thoughts which were lying
    in me like silk in a cocoon--thoughts--bad thoughts maybe--let me think.
    Why did you break your engagement? Why have you never called on us
    afterward? Why don't you want to be with us to-night?
    </p>
    <p>[MISS Y. _makes a motion as if intending to speak_.]</p>
    <p>
    <h6>MRS. X.</h6>No, you don't need to say anything at all. All is clear to me
    now. So, that's the reason of it all. Yes, yes! Everything fits together
    now. Shame on you! I don't want to sit at the same table with you.
    <p>[_Moves her things to another table._]</p> That's why I must put those
    hateful tulips on his slippers--because you love them. <p>[_Throws the
        slippers on the floor._]</p> That's why we have to spend the summer in the
    mountains--because you can't bear the salt smell of the ocean; that's
    why my boy had to be called Eskil--because that was your father's name;
    that's why I had to wear your color, and read your books, and eat your
    favorite dishes, and drink your drinks--this chocolate, for instance;
    that's why--great heavens!--it's terrible to think of it--it's terrible!
    Everything was forced on me by you--even your passions. Your soul bored
    itself into mine as a worm into an apple, and it ate and ate and
    burrowed and burrowed, till nothing was left but the outside shell and a
    little black dust. I wanted to run away from you, but I couldn't. You
    were always on hand like a snake, with your black eyes, to charm me--I
    felt how my wings beat the air only to drag me down--I was in the water
    with my feet tied together, and the harder I worked with my arms, the
    further down I went--down, down, till I sank to the bottom, where you
    lay in wait like a monster crab to catch me with your claws--and now I'm
    there! Shame on you! How I hate you, hate you, hate you! But you, you
    just sit there, silent and calm and indifferent, whether the moon is new
    or full; whether it's Christmas or mid-summer; whether other people are
    happy or unhappy. You are incapable of hatred and you don't know how to
    love. As a cat in front of a mouse-hole, you are sitting there. You
    can't drag your prey out, and you can't pursue it, but you can outwait
    it. Here you sit in this comer--do you know they've nicknamed it "the
    mousetrap" on your account? Here you read the papers to see if anybody
    is in trouble, or if anybody is about to be discharged from the theatre.
    Here you watch your victims and calculate your chances and take your
    tributes. Poor Amelia! Do you know, I pity you all the same, for I know
    you are unhappy--unhappy as one who has been wounded, and malicious
    because you are wounded. I ought to be angry with you, but really I
    can't--you are so small, after all--and as to Bob, why, that does not
    bother me in the least. What does it matter to me, anyhow? If you or
    somebody else taught me to drink chocolate--what of that? <p>[_Takes a
        spoonful of chocolate; then, sententiously._] </p>They say chocolate is very
    wholesome. And if I have learned from you how to dress--_tant
    mieux!_--it has only given me a stronger hold on my husband--and you
    have lost where I have gained. Yes, judging by several signs, I think
    you have lost him already. Of course, you meant me to break with him--as
    you did, and as you are now regretting--but, you see, _I_ never would do
    that. It wouldn't do to be narrow-minded, you know. And why should I
    take only what nobody else wants? Perhaps, after all, I am the stronger
    now. You never got anything from me; you merely gave--and thus happened
    to me what happened to the thief--I had what you missed when you woke
    up. How explain in any other way that, in your hand, everything proved
    worthless and useless? You were never able to keep a man's love, in
    spite of your tulips and your passions--and I could; you could never
    learn the art of living from the books--as I learned it; you bore no
    little Eskil, although that was your father's name. And why do you keep
    silent always and everywhere--silent, ever silent? I used to think it
    was because you were so strong; and maybe the simple truth was you never
    had anything to say--because you were unable to think! <p>[_Rises and picks
        up the slippers._] </p>I'm going home now--I'll take the tulips with
    me--your tulips. You couldn't learn anything from others; you couldn't
    bend--and so you broke like a dry stem--and I didn't. Thank you,
    Amelia, for all your instructions. I thank you that you have taught me
    how to love my husband. Now I'm going home--to him! <p>[_Exit._]</p>
