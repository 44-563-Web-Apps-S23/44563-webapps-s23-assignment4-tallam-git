    <h3>THE STRONGER</h3>
    <h4><i>Written by August Strindberg</i></h4>

    <h6 class="MRS X">MRS. X.</h6>
    <p class="direction" :hover>[_enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a pretty Japanese basket on her
        arm_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MISS Y"> MISS Y.</h6>
    <p class="direction">[_has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she is reading an illustrated weekly,
        and
        every now and then, she exchanges it for a new one_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MRS X">MRS. X.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>
    <p class="direction">[MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes her reading_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MISS Y">MISS Y.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of
        all times. It makes me as sad as when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was reading a comic
        paper and the groom was playing billiards with the witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it
        end? Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going to say that she was reading a comic paper--- 
        that's a different case, my dear.</p>
    <p class="speech">[_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_MRS. X.,_and disappears again_]</p>
    <h6 class="MRS X">MRS. X.</h6>
    <p class="direction">[_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number of Christmas presents._]</p>
    <p class="speech">See what I've bought for my tots.</p>
    <p class="direction"> [_Picks up a doll._]</p>
    <p class="speech">What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her eyes and twist her head, do you
        see? Fine, is it
        not? And here's a cork pistol for Carl.</p>
    <p class="direction">[_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ MISS Y. MISS Y. _starts as if frightened_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MRS X">MRS. X. </h6>
    <p class="speech"> Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you, did you? Really, I didn't think you could
        believe that of me. If you were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got in your way once, and 
        I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
        didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I 
        just the same.</p>
    <p class="direction">[_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._]</p>
    <p class="speech">Well, these are for my hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
        must have them on everything.</p>
    <p class="direction">[MISS Y. _looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled sarcasm and curiosity_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MRS X">MRS. X. </h6>
    <p class="direction">[_Puts a hand in each slipper._] </p>
    <p class="speech"> see what small feet Bob has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never
        seen him in slippers.</p>
    <p class="direction">[MISS Y. _laughs aloud_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MISS Y"> MISS Y.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Look here--here he comes.</p>
    <p class="direction">[_Makes the slippers walk across the table._ MISS Y. _laughs again_.]</p>
    <h6 class="MRS X">MRS. X. </h6>
    <p class="speech">Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this: "Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." 
        Or: "The idiot--now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then there is a draught through the floor and his feet 
        get cold. "Gee, but it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep the house warm."</p>
    <p class="direction">[_She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the other._ MISS Y. _breaks into prolonged laughter_.]</p>
