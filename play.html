        THE STRONGER[M]
        <br>
        SCENE: _A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of
        cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plush, and a few chairs._
        <br>
        MRS. X. _enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
        pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.
        <br>
        MISS Y. _has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
        is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she
        exchanges it for a new one_.
        <br>
        MRS. X. Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
        lonely as a poor bachelor.
        <br>
        <br>
        [MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
        her reading_.]
        <br>
        <br>
        MRS. X. Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
        restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
        when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
        reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
        witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
        Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
        to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
        dear.
        <br>
        <br>
        [_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_ MRS. X.,
        _and disappears again_.
        <br>
        <br>
        MRS. X. [_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
        of Christmas presents._] See what I've bought for my tots. [_Picks up a
        doll._] What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
        eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
        pistol for Carl.
        <br>
        <br>
        [_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ MISS Y. MISS Y. _starts as if
        frightened_.
        <br>
        <br>
        MRS. X. Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
        did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
        were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
        in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
        it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
        didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
        matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.
        [_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._] Well, these are for my
        hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
        must have them on everything.
        <br>
        <br>
        [MISS Y. _looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
        sarcasm and curiosity_.
        <br>
        <br>
        MRS. X. [_Puts a hand in each slipper._] Just see what small feet Bob
        has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never
        seen him in slippers.
        <br>
        <br>
        [MISS Y. _laughs aloud_.
        <br>
        <br>
        MRS. X. Look here--here he comes.
        <br>
        <br>
        [_Makes the slippers walk across the table._ MISS Y. _laughs
        again_.
        <br>
        <br>
        MRS. X. Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this:
        "Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." Or: "The
        idiot--now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then
        there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold. "Gee, but
        it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep
        the house warm."
        <br>
        <br>
        [_She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the
        other._ MISS Y. _breaks into prolonged laughter_.
